#Assignment 1: Writing a basic script
This assignment is very simple. In many ways it is simply practice of what we did in class already. There’s really only a few small expansions to increase the challenge. First, as in the in-class exercise, your script must:
-use both a list and a dictionary (more below, but if you use numpy or pandas, I would waive this requirement if you use arrays)
-use at least one control flow tool
-return some information to the user (e.g., a print function, a calculated value, or an image) 
Your script must include a custom function as before. However, this function must accept some arguments and process those arguments in the function.
This script must use an external library that must be imported. I suggest one of the common libraries that we will be using in this course: numpy and pandas are the two most obvious ones. You can see a list of numpy functions here (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html), and an overview of pandas functions here (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/general_functions.html). 
-Your script must use one of the functions native to a library. That is to say, you can’t just import a library—you have to use it. 
-The function you use must pass arguments that are then processed in some way. This is in addition to the requirement that your custom function must accept arguments.
